## 1. Write a Letter to Your Future Self

## 2. Describe Your Favorite Memory Together

Think back to a cherished memory you shared with the recipient. It could be a special vacation, a memorable celebration, or a simple moment of joy spent together. Describe the experience in detail, evoking sights, sounds, smells, and feelings to bring the memory to life on paper.

## 3. Share Your Bucket List

What are some of the things you hope to experience in your lifetime? Write a letter sharing your bucket list with the recipient. Whether it's traveling to exotic destinations, learning a new skill, or accomplishing a personal goal, share your dreams and aspirations for the future.

## 4. Create a Collaborative Story

Start a collaborative story with the recipient, taking turns writing paragraphs or sentences to continue the narrative.
