## Relevant legal bases

**Relevant legal bases according to the GDPR:** In the following, you will find an overview of the legal basis of the GDPR on which we base the processing of personal data. Please note that in addition to the provisions of the GDPR, national data protection provisions of your or our country of residence or domicile may apply. If, in addition, more specific legal bases are applicable in individual cases, we will inform you of these in the data protection declaration.

*   **Consent (Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR)** - The data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes.
*   **Performance of a contract and prior requests (Article 6 (1) (b) GDPR)** - Performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract.
*   **Legitimate Interests (Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR)** - the processing is necessary for the protection of the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party, provided that the interests, fundamental rights, and freedoms of the data subject, which require the protection of personal data, do not prevail.

**Relevant legal basis according to the Swiss Data Protection Act:** If you are located in Switzerland, we process your data based on the Federal Act on Data Protection (referred to as "Swiss DPA"). Unlike the GDPR, for instance, the Swiss DPA does not generally require that a legal basis for processing personal data be stated and that the processing of personal data is conducted in good faith, lawfully and proportionately (Art. 6 para. 1 and 2 of the Swiss DPA). Furthermore, we only collect personal data for a specific purpose recognizable to the data subject and process it only in a manner compatible with this purpose (Art. 6 para. 3 of the Swiss DPA).

**Reference to the applicability of the GDPR and the Swiss DPA:** These privacy policy serves both to provide information pursuant to the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (FADP) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). For this reason, we ask you to note that due to the broader spatial application and comprehensibility, the terms used in the GDPR are applied. In particular, instead of the terms used in the Swiss FADP such as "processing" of "personal data", "predominant interest", and "particularly sensitive personal data", the terms used in the GDPR, namely "processing" of "personal data", as well as "legitimate interest" and "special categories of data" are used. However, the legal meaning of these terms will continue to be determined according to the Swiss FADP within its scope of application.

## Security Precautions

We take appropriate technical and organisational measures in accordance with the legal requirements, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in order to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.

The measures include, in particular, safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data as well as access to, input, transmission, securing and separation of the data. In addition, we have established procedures to ensure that data subjects' rights are respected, that data is erased, and that we are prepared to respond to data threats rapidly. Furthermore, we take the protection of personal data into account as early as the development or selection of hardware, software and service providers, in accordance with the principle of privacy by design and privacy by default.

Masking of the IP address: If IP addresses are processed by us or by the service providers and technologies used and the processing of a complete IP address is not necessary, the IP address is shortened (also referred to as "IP masking"). In this process, the last two digits or the last part of the IP address after a full stop are removed or replaced by wildcards. The masking of the IP address is intended to prevent the identification of a person by means of their IP address or to make such identification significantly more difficult.

Securing online connections through TLS/SSL encryption technology (HTTPS): To protect the data of users transmitted via our online services from unauthorized access, we employ TLS/SSL encryption technology. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) are the cornerstones of secure data transmission on the internet. These technologies encrypt the information that is transferred between the website or app and the user's browser (or between two servers), thereby safeguarding the data from unauthorized access. TLS, as the more advanced and secure version of SSL, ensures that all data transmissions conform to the highest security standards. When a website is secured with an SSL/TLS certificate, this is indicated by the display of HTTPS in the URL. This serves as an indicator to users that their data is being securely and encryptedly transmitted.

## Transmission of Personal Data

In the course of processing personal data, it may happen that this data is transmitted to or disclosed to other entities, companies, legally independent organizational units, or individuals. Recipients of this data may include service providers tasked with IT duties or providers of services and content that are integrated into a website. In such cases, we observe the legal requirements and particularly conclude relevant contracts or agreements that serve to protect your data with the recipients of your data.

Data Transfer within the Organization: We may transfer personal data to other departments or units within our organisation or grant them access to it. If the data is shared for administrative purposes, it is based on our legitimate business and economic interests or occurs if it is necessary to fulfil our contractual obligations or if the data subjects have given their consent or a legal permission exists.

## International data transfers

Data Processing in Third Countries: If we transfer data to a third country (i.e., outside the European Union (EU) or the European Economic Area (EEA)), or if this occurs in the context of using third-party services or the disclosure or transfer of data to other individuals, entities, or companies (which becomes apparent either from the postal address of the respective provider or when explicitly mentioned in the privacy policy regarding data transfer to third countries), this is always done in accordance with legal requirements.

For data transfers to the USA, we primarily rely on the Data Privacy Framework (DPF), which has been recognized as a secure legal framework by the EU Commission's adequacy decision of July 10, 2023. Additionally, we have concluded Standard Contractual Clauses with the respective providers, which comply with the EU Commission's requirements and establish contractual obligations to protect your data.

This dual safeguard ensures comprehensive protection of your data: The DPF serves as the primary level of protection, while the Standard Contractual Clauses act as an additional security measure. Should any changes occur within the DPF framework, the Standard Contractual Clauses will serve as a reliable fallback option. This ensures that your data remains adequately protected even in the event of political or legal changes.

For individual service providers, we will inform you whether they are certified under the DPF and if Standard Contractual Clauses are in place. The list of certified companies and further information about the DPF can be found on the U.S. Department of Commerce's website at [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/.](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/)

For data transfers to other third countries, appropriate safeguards apply, particularly Standard Contractual Clauses, explicit consent, or legally required transfers. Information on third-country transfers and applicable adequacy decisions can be found in the information provided by the EU Commission: [https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection\_en.](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en)

We will inform you which of our service providers are certified under the Data Privacy Framework as part of our data protection notices.

Disclosure of Personal Data Abroad: In accordance with the Swiss Data Protection Act (Swiss DPA), we only disclose personal data abroad when an appropriate level of protection for the affected persons is ensured (Art. 16 Swiss DPA). If the Federal Council has not determined an adequate level of protection (list of states: [https://www.bj.admin.ch/bj/de/home/staat/datenschutz/internationales/anerkennung-staaten.html](https://www.bj.admin.ch/bj/de/home/staat/datenschutz/internationales/anerkennung-staaten.html)), we implement alternative security measures.

For data transfers to the USA, we primarily rely on the Data Privacy Framework (DPF), which has been recognized as a secure legal framework by Switzerland's adequacy decision of June 7, 2024. Additionally, we have concluded Standard Data Protection Clauses with the respective providers, which have been approved by the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) and establish contractual obligations to protect your data.

This dual safeguard ensures comprehensive protection of your data: The DPF serves as the primary level of protection, while the Standard Data Protection Clauses act as an additional security measure. Should any changes occur within the DPF framework, the Standard Data Protection Clauses will serve as a reliable fallback option. This ensures that your data remains adequately protected even in the event of political or legal changes.

For individual service providers, we will inform you whether they are certified under the DPF and if Standard Data Protection Clauses are in place. The list of certified companies and further information about the DPF can be found on the U.S. Department of Commerce's website at [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/.](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/)

For data transfers to other third countries, appropriate safeguards apply, including international agreements, specific guarantees, FDPIC-approved Standard Data Protection Clauses, or internal company data protection regulations previously recognized by the FDPIC or a competent data protection authority of another country.

Under Art. 16 of the Swiss DPA, exceptions can be made for the disclosure of data abroad if certain conditions are met, including the consent of the affected person, contract execution, public interest, protection of life or physical integrity, publicly made data, or data from a legally provided register. Such disclosures always comply with the legal requirements.

We will inform you which of our service providers are certified under the Data Privacy Framework as part of our privacy notices.

## General Information on Data Retention and Deletion

We delete personal data that we process in accordance with legal regulations as soon as the underlying consents are revoked or no further legal bases for processing exist. This applies to cases where the original purpose of processing is no longer applicable or the data is no longer needed. Exceptions to this rule exist if statutory obligations or special interests require a longer retention or archiving of the data.

In particular, data that must be retained for commercial or tax law reasons, or whose storage is necessary for legal prosecution or protection of the rights of other natural or legal persons, must be archived accordingly.

Our privacy notices contain additional information on the retention and deletion of data specifically applicable to certain processing processes.

In cases where multiple retention periods or deletion deadlines for a date are specified, the longest period always prevails.

If a period does not expressly start on a specific date and lasts at least one year, it automatically begins at the end of the calendar year in which the event triggering the period occurred. In the case of ongoing contractual relationships in the context of which data is stored, the event triggering the deadline is the time at which the termination or other termination of the legal relationship takes effect.

Data that is no longer stored for its originally intended purpose but due to legal requirements or other reasons are processed exclusively for the reasons justifying their retention.

**Further information on processing methods, procedures and services used:**

*   **Data Retention and Deletion:** The following general retention and archiving periods apply under Swiss law:
    *   10 years - Retention period for books and records, annual financial statements, inventories, management reports, opening balances, accounting vouchers and invoices, as well as all necessary working instructions and other organizational documents (Article 958f of the Swiss Code of Obligations (OR)).
    *   10 years - Data necessary to consider potential claims for damages or similar contractual claims and rights, as well as for the processing of related inquiries based on previous business experiences and usual industry practices, will be stored for the statutory limitation period of ten years, unless a shorter period of five years is applicable, which is relevant in certain cases (Articles 127, 130 OR). Claims for rent, lease, and interest on capital, as well as other periodic services, for the delivery of food, for board and lodging, for innkeeper debts, as well as for craftsmanship, small-scale sales of goods, medical care, professional services by lawyers, legal agents, procurators, and notaries, and from the employment relationship of employees, expire after five years (Article 128 OR).

## Use of Cookies

The term "cookies" refers to functions that store information on users' devices and read it from them. Cookies can also be used for different purposes, such as ensuring the functionality, security, and convenience of online services, as well as analyzing visitor traffic. We use cookies in accordance with legal regulations. If necessary, we obtain users' consent in advance. If consent is not required, we rely on our legitimate interests. This applies when storing and reading information is essential to provide explicitly requested content and functions. This includes, for example, saving settings and ensuring the functionality and security of our online services. Consent can be withdrawn at any time. We clearly inform users about the scope of the consent and which cookies are used.

**Information on legal data protection bases:** Whether we process personal data using cookies depends on users' consent. If consent is given, it serves as the legal basis. Without consent, we rely on our legitimate interests, as outlined in this section and in the context of the respective services and procedures.

**Storage duration:** The following types of cookies are distinguished based on their storage duration:

*   **Temporary cookies (also: session cookies):** Temporary cookies are deleted at the latest after a user leaves an online service and closes their device (e.g., browser or mobile application).
*   **Permanent cookies:** Permanent cookies remain stored even after the device is closed. For example, the login status can be saved, and preferred content can be displayed directly when the user revisits a website. Additionally, the user data collected with cookies may be used for audience measurement. Unless we provide explicit information to users about the type and storage duration of cookies (e.g., when obtaining consent), users should assume that these are permanent and may have a storage duration of up to two years.

**General information on withdrawal and objection (opt-out):** Users can withdraw their consent at any time and also object to the processing according to legal regulations, including through the privacy settings of their browser.

*   **Processed data types:** Meta, communication and process data (e.g. IP addresses, timestamps, identification numbers, involved parties).
*   **Data subjects:** Users (e.g. website visitors, users of online services).
*   **Legal Basis:** Legitimate Interests (Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR). Consent (Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR).

**Further information on processing methods, procedures and services used:**

*   **Processing Cookie Data on the Basis of Consent:** We implement a consent management solution that obtains users' consent for the use of cookies or for the processes and providers mentioned within the consent management framework. This procedure is designed to solicit, log, manage, and revoke consents, particularly regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies employed to store, read from, and process information on users' devices. As part of this procedure, user consents are obtained for the use of cookies and the associated processing of information, including specific processing and providers named in the consent management process. Users also have the option to manage and withdraw their consents. Consent declarations are stored to avoid repeated queries and to provide proof of consent according to legal requirements. The storage is carried out server-side and/or in a cookie (so-called opt-in cookie) or by means of comparable technologies in order to associate the consent with a specific user or their device.If no specific details about the providers of consent management services are provided, the following general notes apply: The duration of consent storage is up to two years. A pseudonymous user identifier is created, which is stored along with the time of consent, details on the scope of consent (e.g., relevant categories of cookies and/or service providers), as well as information about the browser, system, and device used; **Legal Basis:** Consent (Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR).

## Special Notes on Applications (Apps)

We process the data of the users of our application to the extent necessary to provide the users with the application and its functionalities, to monitor its security and to develop it further. Furthermore, we may contact users in compliance with the statutory provisions if communication is necessary for the purposes of administration or use of the application. In addition, we refer to the data protection information in this privacy policy with regard to the processing of user data.

**Legal basis:** The processing of data necessary for the provision of the functionalities of the application serves to fulfil contractual obligations. This also applies if the provision of the functions requires user authorisation (e.g. release of device functions). If the processing of data is not necessary for the provision of the functionalities of the application, but serves the security of the application or our business interests (e.g. collection of data for the purpose of optimising the application or security purposes), it is carried out on the basis of our legitimate interests. If users are expressly requested to give their consent to the processing of their data, the data covered by the consent is processed on the basis of the consent.

*   **Processed data types:** Inventory data (For example, the full name, residential address, contact information, customer number, etc.); Usage data (e.g. page views and duration of visit, click paths, intensity and frequency of use, types of devices and operating systems used, interactions with content and features); Meta, communication and process data (e.g. IP addresses, timestamps, identification numbers, involved parties); Payment Data (e.g. bank details, invoices, payment history). Contract data (e.g. contract object, duration, customer category).
*   **Data subjects:** Users (e.g. website visitors, users of online services).
*   **Purposes of processing:** Provision of contractual services and fulfillment of contractual obligations; Security measures. Provision of our online services and usability.
*   **Retention and deletion:** Deletion in accordance with the information provided in the section "General Information on Data Retention and Deletion".
*   **Legal Basis:** Performance of a contract and prior requests (Article 6 (1) (b) GDPR). Legitimate Interests (Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR).

**Further information on processing methods, procedures and services used:**

*   **Commercial use:** We process the data of the users of our application, registered and any test users (hereinafter uniformly referred to as "users") in order to provide them with our contractual services and on the basis of legitimate interests to ensure the security of our application and to develop it further. The required details are identified as such within the scope of the conclusion of a contract for the use of the application, the conclusion of an order, an order or a comparable contract and may include the details required for the provision of services and any invoicing as well as contact information in order to be able to hold any consultations; **Legal Basis:** Performance of a contract and prior requests (Article 6 (1) (b) GDPR).
*   **Storage of the universally unique identifier (UUID):** The application stores a so-called Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) for the purpose of analysing the use and functionality of the application and storing the user's settings. This identifier is generated when the application is installed (but is not connected to the device, so no device ID in this sense), remains stored between the start of the application and its updates and is deleted when users remove the application from their device.
*   **Storage of an own unique identifier:** In order to provide the application and ensure its functionality, we use a pseudonymous identifier. The identifier is a mathematical value (i.e. no clear data such as names are used) that is assigned to a device and/or the installation of the application installed on it. This identifier is generated during the installation of the application, remains stored between the start of the application and its updates and is deleted when users remove the application from the device.
*   **Device authorizations for access to functions and data:** The use of certain functions of our application may require access to the camera and the stored recordings of the users. By default, these authorizations must be granted by the user and can be revoked at any time in the settings of the respective devices. The exact procedure for controlling app permissions may depend on the user's device and software. Users can contact us if they require further explanation. We would like to point out that the refusal or revocation of the respective authorizations can affect the functionality of our application.
*   **Processing of stored contacts:** When using our application, the contact information of persons (e.g. name, e-mail address and telephone number) stored in the contact directory of the device is processed. The use of the contact information requires user authorization, which can be withdrawn at any time. The use of the contact information serves only to provide the respective functionality of our application, according to its description to the users, or its typical and expectable functionality. Users are advised that permission to process the contact information must be granted and, especially in the case of natural persons, their consent or a legal permission is required.

According to the term "AI system" as defined in Article 3 No. 1 of the AI Regulation, we understand AI to be a machine-based system designed for varying degrees of autonomous operation, capable of adaptation after deployment, and producing outputs such as predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions that can influence physical or virtual environments.

Our AI systems are used in strict compliance with legal requirements. These include both specific regulations for artificial intelligence and data protection requirements. In particular, we adhere to the principles of lawfulness, transparency, fairness, human oversight, purpose limitation, data minimisation, integrity and confidentiality. We ensure that the processing of personal data is always based on a legal foundation. This may either be the consent of the data subjects or a statutory permission.

When using external AI systems, we carefully select their providers (hereinafter referred to as "AI providers"). In accordance with our legal obligations, we ensure that the AI providers comply with applicable provisions. We also observe our duties when using or operating the acquired AI services. The processing of personal data by us and the AI providers is carried out exclusively on the basis of consent or legal authorisation. We place particular emphasis on transparency, fairness and maintaining human oversight over AI-supported decision-making processes.

To protect processed data, we implement appropriate and robust technical as well as organisational measures.

## Cloud Services

We use Internet-accessible software services (so-called "cloud services", also referred to as "Software as a Service") provided on the servers of its providers for the storage and management of content (e.g. document storage and management, exchange of documents, content and information with certain recipients or publication of content and information).

Within this framework, personal data may be processed and stored on the provider's servers insofar as this data is part of communication processes with us or is otherwise processed by us in accordance with this privacy policy. This data may include in particular master data and contact data of data subjects, data on processes, contracts, other proceedings and their contents. Cloud service providers also process usage data and metadata that they use for security and service optimization purposes.

If we use cloud services to provide documents and content to other users or publicly accessible websites, forms, etc., providers may store cookies on users' devices for web analysis or to remember user settings (e.g. in the case of media control).

## Web Analysis, Monitoring and Optimization

Web analytics (also referred to as "reach measurement") is used to evaluate the visitor flows of our online services and may include pseudonymous values related to visitor behavior, interests, or demographic information such as age or gender. Through reach analysis, we can, for example, identify when our online services or their functions and content are most frequently used or likely to encourage repeat visits. It also enables us to determine which areas need optimization.

In addition to web analytics, we may also use testing procedures to test and optimize different versions of our online services or their components.

Unless otherwise specified below, profiles (i.e., data combined from a usage process) may be created for these purposes, and information can be stored in and later retrieved from a browser or device. The data collected includes, in particular, visited websites and elements used on them, as well as technical information such as the browser used, the computer system, and information about usage times. If users have given consent to the collection of their location data to us or to the providers of the services we use, the processing of location data is also possible.

Additionally, users' IP addresses are stored. However, we use an IP masking process (i.e., pseudonymization by shortening the IP address) to protect users. In general, no clear user data (such as email addresses or names) is stored as part of web analytics, A/B testing, or optimization. Instead, pseudonyms are used. This means that neither we nor the providers of the software used know the actual identity of the users, only the information stored in their profiles for the respective procedures.

Legal basis information: If we ask users for their consent to use third-party providers, the legal basis for data processing is consent. Otherwise, user data is processed based on our legitimate interests (i.e., our interest in efficient, economic, and user-friendly services). In this context, we would also like to point out the information on the use of cookies in this privacy policy.

*   **Processed data types:** Usage data (e.g. page views and duration of visit, click paths, intensity and frequency of use, types of devices and operating systems used, interactions with content and features). Meta, communication and process data (e.g. IP addresses, timestamps, identification numbers, involved parties).
*   **Data subjects:** Users (e.g. website visitors, users of online services).
*   **Purposes of processing:** Web Analytics (e.g. access statistics, recognition of returning visitors); Profiles with user-related information (Creating user profiles). Provision of our online services and usability.
*   **Retention and deletion:** Deletion in accordance with the information provided in the section "General Information on Data Retention and Deletion". Storage of cookies for up to 2 years (Unless otherwise stated, cookies and similar storage methods may be stored on users' devices for a period of two years.).
*   **Security measures:** IP Masking (Pseudonymization of the IP address).
*   **Legal Basis:** Consent (Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR). Legitimate Interests (Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR).

**Further information on processing methods, procedures and services used:**

*   **Google Analytics:** We use Google Analytics to perform measurement and analysis of the use of our online services by users based on a pseudonymous user identification number. This identification number does not contain any unique data, such as names or email addresses. It is used to assign analysis information to an end device in order to recognize which content users have accessed within one or various usage processes, which search terms they have used, have accessed again or have interacted with our online services. Likewise, the time of use and its duration are stored, as well as the sources of users referring to our online services and technical aspects of their end devices and browsers.  
    In the process, pseudonymous profiles of users are created with information from the use of various devices, and cookies may be used. Google Analytics does not log or store individual IP addresses. Analytics does provide coarse geo-location data by deriving the following metadata from IP addresses: City (and the derived latitude, and longitude of the city), Continent, Country, Region, Subcontinent (and ID-based counterparts). For EU-based traffic, IP-address data is used solely for geo-location data derivation before being immediately discarded. It is not logged, accessible, or used for any additional use cases. When Analytics collects measurement data, all IP lookups are performed on EU-based servers before forwarding traffic to Analytics servers for processing; **Service provider**: Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland; **Legal Basis:** Consent (Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR); **Website:** [https://marketingplatform.google.com/intl/en/about/analytics/](https://marketingplatform.google.com/intl/en/about/analytics/); **Security measures:** IP Masking (Pseudonymization of the IP address); **Privacy Policy:** [https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy); **Data Processing Agreement:** [https://business.safety.google/adsprocessorterms/](https://business.safety.google/adsprocessorterms/); **Basis for third-country transfers:** EEA - Data Privacy Framework (DPF), Standard Contractual Clauses ([https://business.safety.google/adsprocessorterms](https://business.safety.google/adsprocessorterms)), Switzerland - Data Privacy Framework (DPF), Standard Contractual Clauses ( [https://business.safety.google/adsprocessorterms](https://business.safety.google/adsprocessorterms)); **Opt-Out:** Opt-Out-Plugin: [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en), Settings for the Display of Advertisements: [https://myadcenter.google.com/personalizationoff](https://myadcenter.google.com/personalizationoff). **Further Information:** [https://business.safety.google/adsservices/](https://business.safety.google/adsservices/) (Types of processing and data processed).

## Online Marketing

We process personal data for the purposes of online marketing, which may include in particular the marketing of advertising space or the display of advertising and other content (collectively referred to as "Content") based on the potential interests of users and the measurement of their effectiveness.

For these purposes, so-called user profiles are created and stored in a file (so-called "cookie") or similar procedure is used by which the relevant user information for the display of the aforementioned content is stored. This information may include, for example, content viewed, websites visited, online networks used, communication partners and technical information such as the browser used, computer system used and information on usage times and used functions. If users have consented to the collection of their sideline data, these can also be processed.

The IP addresses of the users are also stored. However, we use provided IP masking procedures (i.e. pseudonymisation by shortening the IP address) to ensure the protection of the user's by using a pseudonym. In general, within the framework of the online marketing process, no clear user data (such as e-mail addresses or names) is secured, but pseudonyms. This means that we, as well as the providers of online marketing procedures, do not know the actual identity of the users, but only the information stored in their profiles.

The information in the profiles is usually stored in the cookies or similar memorizing procedures. These cookies can later, generally also on other websites that use the same online marketing technology, be read and analyzed for purposes of content display, as well as supplemented with other data and stored on the server of the online marketing technology provider.

Exceptionally, clear data can be assigned to the profiles. This is the case, for example, if the users are members of a social network whose online marketing technology we use and the network links the profiles of the users in the aforementioned data. Please note that users may enter into additional agreements with the social network providers or other service providers, e.g. by consenting as part of a registration process.

As a matter of principle, we only gain access to summarised information about the performance of our advertisements. However, within the framework of so-called conversion measurement, we can check which of our online marketing processes have led to a so-called conversion, i.e. to the conclusion of a contract with us. The conversion measurement is used alone for the performance analysis of our marketing activities.

Unless otherwise stated, we kindly ask you to consider that cookies used will be stored for a period of two years.

**Notes on revocation and objection:**

We refer to the privacy policies of the respective service providers and the possibilities for objection (so-called "opt-out"). If no explicit opt-out option has been specified, it is possible to deactivate cookies in the settings of your browser. However, this may restrict the functions of our online offer.

## Profiles in Social Networks (Social Media)

We maintain online presences within social networks and process user data in this context in order to communicate with the users active there or to offer information about us.

We would like to point out that user data may be processed outside the European Union. This may entail risks for users, e.g. by making it more difficult to enforce users' rights.

In addition, user data is usually processed within social networks for market research and advertising purposes. For example, user profiles can be created on the basis of user behaviour and the associated interests of users. The user profiles can then be used, for example, to place advertisements within and outside the networks which are presumed to correspond to the interests of the users. For these purposes, cookies are usually stored on the user's computer, in which the user's usage behaviour and interests are stored. Furthermore, data can be stored in the user profiles independently of the devices used by the users (especially if the users are members of the respective networks or will become members later on).

For a detailed description of the respective processing operations and the opt-out options, please refer to the respective data protection declarations and information provided by the providers of the respective networks.

Also in the case of requests for information and the exercise of rights of data subjects, we point out that these can be most effectively pursued with the providers. Only the providers have access to the data of the users and can directly take appropriate measures and provide information. If you still need help, please do not hesitate to contact us.

*   **Processed data types:** Contact data (e.g. postal and email addresses or phone numbers); Content data (e.g. textual or pictorial messages and contributions, as well as information pertaining to them, such as details of authorship or the time of creation.). Usage data (e.g. page views and duration of visit, click paths, intensity and frequency of use, types of devices and operating systems used, interactions with content and features).

## Plugins and embedded functions and content

Within our online services, we integrate functional and content elements that are obtained from the servers of their respective providers (hereinafter referred to as "third-party providers"). These may, for example, be graphics, videos or city maps (hereinafter uniformly referred to as "Content").

The integration always presupposes that the third-party providers of this content process the IP address of the user, since they could not send the content to their browser without the IP address. The IP address is therefore required for the presentation of these contents or functions. We strive to use only those contents, whose respective offerers use the IP address only for the distribution of the contents. Third parties may also use so-called pixel tags (invisible graphics, also known as "web beacons") for statistical or marketing purposes. The "pixel tags" can be used to evaluate information such as visitor traffic on the pages of this website. The pseudonymous information may also be stored in cookies on the user's device and may include technical information about the browser and operating system, referring websites, visit times and other information about the use of our website, as well as may be linked to such information from other sources.
